## Motivation: 
In recent years, Vietnam has emerged as a regional startup hub in Southeast Asia, closely competing with Indonesia and Singapore. Vietnam indeed has many potential startups with passionate entrepreneurs who come up with innovative ideas. However, several challenges constrain the execution of the business ideas or the growth of startup projects.

We founded COLEAD as a social network platform for entrepreneurs. Our mission is to encourage the entrepreneurship spirit and support promising startup ideas and projects.

At COLEAD, the entrepreneurs can showcase their business ideas or startup projects to other users and request support (finance, human, service, or guidance). We believe that the platform will create more connections and collaborations in the Vietnam startup ecosystem. As a result, we will have more and more unicorns in the future.
